# Finding .Wav (wuv)

**Like a dating app, but for making playlists.**

An app to help you find the songs that you *actually* want, or... hear me out... wav... to have on your playlists by asking you to make it while listening to the songs.


## Features
- Choose to listen to the songs or go off just looks... how vain...
- Swipe like any self-respecting dating app (right = yes, left = no)
- Buttons to swipe for you, if you're too lazy to swipe those matches
- Skipped a song right at the end? It's added to the playlist since you liked it enough to listen
- Exporting of playlists as .m3u, saved to your music folder
- Fully offline (works off your downloaded songs)
- Fully-Functioning Playhead Seeker (ignore the slight jitters, drank too many energy drinks)
